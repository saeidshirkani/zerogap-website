          <h2>Our story</h2>
          <p>ZeroGap Security was founded on a simple idea: understanding how real systems fail is the key to securing them effectively.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="timeline">

          <div class="step">
            <div class="step-num">01</div>
            <h3>Curiosity for how systems break</h3>
            <p>Everything started with analysing real-world failures — software defects, misconfigurations, overlooked assumptions, and cascading outages that revealed how fragile modern systems can be. This foundation created a mindset focused on root causes rather than surface symptoms.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <div class="step-num">02</div>
            <h3>Entering offensive security</h3>
            <p>That curiosity naturally evolved into structured learning in offensive security: penetration testing, web application security, network hardening, and the techniques used by real attackers. Understanding failure from the attacker’s point of view made the picture complete.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <div class="step-num">03</div>
            <h3>Building ZeroGap Security</h3>
            <p>The vision emerged clearly: a focused offensive security studio for Swiss SMEs and startups — offering deep manual testing, clear communication, and practical guidance without unnecessary complexity or corporate overhead.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <div class="step-num">04</div>
            <h3>Looking ahead</h3>
            <p>Today we continue refining our methodology, adopting AI only where it truly adds value, and working with a small number of clients to ensure depth, continuity, and long-term security improvement.</p>

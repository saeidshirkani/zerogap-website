              <h2>A small studio by design</h2>
              <p>ZeroGap Security is intentionally a small, focused security studio — with less overhead, fewer layers, and more attention on the systems we actually test.</p>
            </div>

            <p>Instead of anonymous rotating consultants, you work directly with the specialist performing your assessment. This ensures continuity, accountability, and a deeper understanding of your environment.</p>

            <p>Our methodology blends curiosity-driven manual exploration with carefully selected tools and AI assistance — without turning your infrastructure into yet another automated scan.</p>

            <h3>What matters to us</h3>
            <p>We value clarity over buzzwords, realistic risk over fear, and meaningful improvement over endless reporting.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Transparent and honest communication about real risk</li>
              <li>Helping engineers fix issues, not simply listing vulnerabilities</li>
              <li>A practical balance between security, usability and delivery speed</li>
              <li>Building long-term security maturity step by step</li>
